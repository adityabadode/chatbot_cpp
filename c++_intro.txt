C++ INTRODUCTION

1.  What is C++? C++ is a general-purpose programming language developed
    by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 at Bell Labs. It is an extension of the
    C programming language and adds Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
    features such as classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.

2.  Why C++ is Important

-   High performance and efficiency
-   Used in system programming and game development
-   Widely used in competitive programming
-   Supports both procedural and object-oriented paradigms
-   Provides low-level memory control

3.  Features of C++

-   Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
-   Encapsulation
-   Abstraction
-   Inheritance
-   Polymorphism
-   Function Overloading
-   Operator Overloading
-   Templates (Generic Programming)
-   Standard Template Library (STL)

4.  Structure of a Simple C++ Program A basic C++ program generally
    contains:

-   Preprocessor directives (#include)
-   main() function
-   Statements and expressions
-   Return statement

5.  Applications of C++

-   Game Development (Unreal Engine)
-   Operating Systems
-   Embedded Systems
-   Banking and Finance Applications
-   Competitive Programming
-   High-performance Applications

6.  Advantages of C++

-   Fast execution speed
-   Memory management control
-   Portable and widely supported
-   Strong community support

7.  Limitations of C++

-   Complex syntax for beginners
-   Manual memory management
-   Large language with many features

Conclusion C++ is a powerful and flexible programming language suitable
for system-level programming, competitive programming, and
performance-critical applications. Mastering C++ provides a strong
foundation in programming concepts and computer science fundamentals.
